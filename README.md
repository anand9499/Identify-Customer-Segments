# Overview

The project used a proprietary data set of German population data and customer data from a mail-order company to be able to identify under-representation and over-representation of customer segments between the two populations.

The project involved data wrangling and feature engineering to develop a data set for analysis, using Principal Component Analysis to segment the data and KMeans to compare segments between the two datasets.


# Key Findings

A number of segments were able to be clearly identified and defined including city-living youth, "traditional German" elders, and savvy male investors
Analysis of the missing data did suggest that they were a different population segment and this was included in the segment comparisons
There were a number of segments for the mail-order company that were over- and underrepresented compared to the general population
Over- and underrepresentation appeared to follow expectations based on some stereotypes associated with the segments, for example, city-living youth were underrepresented and "traditional German" elders were overrepresented
